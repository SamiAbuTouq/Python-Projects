# 100 Days of Python – Course Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed as part of the **100 Days of Python** course.

## Description
Each project in this repository represents a practical exercise or mini-application built while progressing through the course.  
The projects cover a wide range of Python concepts, including scripting, automation, web development, APIs, databases, authentication, and GUI applications.

All projects are organized into separate folders, each with its own `README.md` explaining the purpose and functionality of that specific project.

## Note
These projects were created for **learning and practice purposes** as part of the 100 Days of Python curriculum and demonstrate incremental progress in Python development skills.
